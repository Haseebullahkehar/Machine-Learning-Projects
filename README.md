## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of machine learning projects developed to solve different problems using various techniques and models. Each project folder contains Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and datasets required to run the project.

## Projects

### Book Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

This project develops a recommendation system to suggest books to users based on their reading history and preferences. It uses collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations.

### Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

Similar to the book recommendation system, this project focuses on recommending movies to users. It explores various collaborative filtering methods and evaluates their performance.

### Dataset Preprocessing Tool

This tool automates the preprocessing of datasets, including tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features. It's designed to be user-friendly and can be adapted to various datasets.

### Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning models. The analysis includes feature selection, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

### Mini ML Projects

A collection of smaller machine learning projects that cover a range of topics and techniques, providing quick insights and hands-on practice with different algorithms.

### Real-Time Object Detection

This project focuses on real-time object detection using deep learning models. It involves training a model on labeled images and deploying it to detect objects in live video feeds.
